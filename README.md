Analyzing the air quality with different weather conditions.

## Conclusion
After analysing the dataset, I concluded the following:
1. The mean PM2.5 level was 97.80 ug/m3. For each year, the PM2.5 average was also around the same. This shows that the city's air quality is poor.

2. The PM2.5 levels were highest during the winter season i.e., from December to February. The levels for the Autumn season also surpassed the safe zone threshold.

3. Lower wind speeds corresponded to higher PM2.5 levels.

4. Higher levels of PM2.5 occurs more often when the wind direction is going towards the South West (SW) then the South East. It gets extremely high during the winter period when the wind direction is headed towards the South East and South West.

5. No relationship observed between temperature and PM2.5 levels.

6. There was steady pressure level of ~1 atm.

7. Low hours of precipitation (rainfall) correlated to higher levels of PM2.5. Low PM2.5 levels observed when precipitation was for longer hours.
